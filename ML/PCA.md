## Why?
- High dimension data problem
- Reduce compute cost
- Remove collinearity
## Basic concept
- PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data (the principal components) and projects the data onto these directions to achieve dimensionality reduction.
### Steps
- Standardization data
- Compute
