- What is process?
	- the process in memory
	- the process is the program being executed
- describe the feature
- understand the shared memory mechanism and message passing mechanism
- the coummunication in server system

## What is process
- Multiple parts 
	- text section : program code
	- program counter : the address of the next instruction
	- stack : function parameter, return address, local variables
	- data section : global variables
	- heap : allocate the memory dynamically
- Process state
	- new : being created
	- running : being executed
	- waiting : waiting for some event to occur
	- ready : event is done, so state ready to be assigned 
	- terminated : finished executed
## Feature 
- Process Control Block ( PCB )
	- process state 
	- process number
	- program counter
	- registers
	- memory limit
	- list of open files
- Switch

- Process Scheduling
	- For maximize CPU use
	- Scheduling queues
		- Job queue
		- Ready queue
		- Device queue
		- the others
- CPU scheduling
	- Short-term scheduler ( CPU scheduler ) : 選擇 Ready queue 中的 process 給 CPU 做
	- Long-term scheduler ( job scheduler ) : 為了讓 CPU 使用最高效，所以會一直安排工作到 ready queue 上，調控系統中 process 的數量 ( degree of multiprogramming )

	- Medium-term scheduler : 將一些需要很久時間的 process 先存到磁碟，然後在轉到 ready queue
